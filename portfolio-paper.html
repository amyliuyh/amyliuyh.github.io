            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                <p class="lead">For Chinese cities, the visual effects of contemporary urban and landscape design play a rather big role in decision-making processes. 3D-modelling, animations and renderings of planning projects are essential, but usually depict an aspired ideal. Facing reality though, there often exists a large gap between expectations and the build environment. Throughout the years of rapid urbanization car-oriented planning and spectacular lighthouse projects dominated the urban agenda.<br><br>

Research studies revealed that exposure to natural environments would trigger positive affective responses and enhanced cognitive functions (Velarde et al. 2007; Bowler et al. 2010). Therefore, frequent access to nature may enhance human mental health. On the opposite side, city dwellers, with limited access to nature, were found more likely to suffer from mental diseases and poorer psychological well-being (Lederbogen et al. 2011; Tost et al. 2015). Up to now, findings were mostly confirmatory verifying the effect of natural environments on human affective responses. However, a recent study revealed that visual aesthetics may be another important - if not more significant - environmental factor on human health additional to nature (Seresinhe et al. 2015). Seresihe et al. revealed that better scenic view correlated with lower sickness report spatially. Surprisingly, after controlling the health effects from scenic views, they did not find relevant health benefits residual from ecological and environmental effects produced by green plants. In other words, scenic views may have a significant impact on human well-being, which may be comparable to environmental or ecological effects on health. Following those arguments, the designs of urban landscapes matter, not only in the meaning of functionality and comfort, but also for aesthetics and views.<br><br>

In China, the past urban development has been criticized for its lack of human scale design (Kögel &amp; Meyer 2000; Chen &amp; Thwaites 2013). Rapid urbanization and pancake-like urban growth has produced uninviting, car-dependent cities, where only outstanding and sometimes highly exaggerated architectural forms trigger visual responses (Pan 2011; Chen &amp; Thwaites 2013).<br><br>

Several studies in recent years have discussed the proposals of re-implementation of traditional elements and design aesthetics in Chinese urban and landscape planning for the purpose of creating identities and livable places (Chen &amp; Thwaites 2013; Hassenpflug 2013; Wang &amp; Meng 2015; Wang &amp; Ruan 2015). In the process of smart city approaches of Chinese cities, the understanding of people's well-being and interaction with their urban environments have gained unprecedented importance in planning practice.<br><br>

This paper is designed to identify potential stressors as well as negative and positive environmental stimulators in built environment, using wearable physiological sensors and GPS devices. An 8-channeled Procomp Infiniti device was used in this study, recording electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), skin conductance (SC), skin temperature (ST), electromyography (EMG) of facial muscles expression and respiration, with a maximum sample rate at 1024/s. Participants in the pilot experiment were asked to take a 15-minute walk on a designated route for three times within a building. Physiological measures were first filtered and then combined with GPS locations and visual eyesight. Affective mapping analysis based on the collected data allows first conclusions on the responsiveness of participants towards different visual experiences. Further analyses will determine the impacts of urban environments on stressors and what role latest technological advancements in smart landscape design in form of augmented reality can play for improved well-being of city dwellers.<br><br>

In this study, six channels were used, including (1) EKG, (2) EEG, (3) facial EMG, (4) skin conductance and skin temperature, (5) respiration. Each biosensor transmits its measurements to an “on-board” recording device (6), which again is linked to an ordinary laptop or computer. Valence can be reflected by the data of HR and EMG, while Arousal by the data of EEG and SCR (skin conductance rate).<br><br>

After signal filtering, we used heart rate from EKG and facial EMG to predict valence, that is, whether one feels pleasant or not. We used skin conductance response from SC and several indicators from EKG to predict arousal, that is, how much one feels aroused by the stimuli. The affective valence and arouse are two important dimensions to describe emotions emotion studies. Empirical studies revealed that the indicators we used in this study were strongly correlated with the two dimensions.<br><br>

Initial results revealed promising results which fitted well with subjective-reported experience collected via interview. The general emotion distribution can be portrayed based on the analysis of usable geo-based physiological indexes. Thus, hot spot (positive or negative) could be identified and the following map could be made, representing a project-specific and user-specific diagnosis of environmental experience. In this case, seven meaningful hot spots for emotional responses are depicted, three of which with unpleasant and three with mostly pleasant emotional responses.<br><br>

Besides the outdoor experiment, we also conducted another indoor experiment using the same bio-feedback sensors. Since satellite based GPS sensors did not perform well enough within buildings, we used WIFI geographic location service instead for better location accuracy. The bio-feedback results generated in indoor experiment also corresponded well with subjective measures.<br><br>

Human experience matters. However the lack of evidence and distortion in the gathering of real time information, along with the absence of in-situ interaction have impeded the development of landscape architecture practice. The affective mapping technique, although preliminary yet, could to some degree capture the in-situ intuitive reaction to the diversity of environmental factors that influence human perceptions and behaviors. In view of the biological feedback, geographic information collaboration platform and augmented reality technology, a design supporting system can be built where the biofeedback technology could make up for the deficiencies in the subjective awareness among the overall environmental perception and affective mapping could clearly depict environmental stressors as well as attractors, thus providing better quantitative reference for planning and design.<br><br>
